5. This opens the terminal application, that can be used by the user to explore the features offered in this implementation.

> It should be noted that the application creates a new folder labelled **`FMS_Root`**, and runs with this as the root directory. All commands are expected to be relative to this directory.

>It should also be noted that the application runs in the global scope of the machine, thus it will not effect the files present outside the *root*, until **EXPLICITLY** told to do so. Thus, user desgretion is advised.
